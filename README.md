## WPI DS595 - Reinforcement Learning

This project aims to use DQN (Deep Q-Learning Network) to learn how to pick objects in a simulated environment using a Franka robotic arm. 
The simulation is done in Gazebo and communicates through ROS with our network. We have used the DeepAI Atari DQN environment and file structure 
as a basis for our own network.
